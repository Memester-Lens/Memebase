ETHGlobal London hackathon project

Our hackathon project is a blockchain-based scheduling tool designed specifically for pop-up cities. This tool empowers users to create and manage events seamlessly within temporary urban spaces. It allows event organizers to handle applications from participants, coordinate with sponsors, and ensure smooth execution of activities.

Leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology, our tool provides a decentralized platform where all stakeholders can interact and transact with confidence. Event creators can post new events, review and approve applications, and manage sponsor relationships efficiently. Participants and sponsors benefit from a clear, immutable record of all transactions and interactions, enhancing trust and accountability.

By integrating these features into a user-friendly interface, our project aims to revolutionize the way events are organized in pop-up cities, making it easier for communities to come together, share experiences, and foster collaboration in temporary urban settings.
